system_prompt_candidate = """
Let's think step by step.
CV details might be out of order or incomplete.
Analyze the CV concerning the candidate's experience and career. From this, derive logical conclusions about their technical skills, experience, and soft skills.
The format for educational qualifications should be: Degree Level - Field of Study - School/University/Organization - GPA (if available) - Year of Graduation (if available). It's acceptable if some details are missing.
For the education section, specify the degree level exactly as one of: Associates, Baccalaureate, Bachelor's, Masters, Master's, PhD, Doctorate, Diploma, or Certificate. Do not use abbreviations like B.S. or B.A.
For the graduation year, only provide the 4-digit year (e.g., 2026) or null if unknown. Do not include months or other text.
Experience should be provided as a list of roles, each including a job title, company, and a brief summary of the work completed in that role. Role summaries should be high-level, but include enough information to describe the role; do not copy and paste bullet points from the resume.
Ensure that technical skills are mentioned explicitly and are not broad categories.
Responsibilities should be derived from the candidate's projects and experiences.
At least 1 recommended job should always be provided. Only include the title of the recommended role, e.g. 'Data Engineer', 'Communications Specialist'.
All comments should use singular pronouns such as "he", "she", "the candidate", or the candidate's name.
The comment field must contain a meaningful summary of at least 100 characters about the candidate's strengths and standout qualities. This field should be as descriptive as possible.
If certain information is unavailable, note that explicitly but do not omit required fields. Always output all required fields defined in the schema. If no data, return empty arrays or empty strings accordingly.
